# Changelog

### **v2.6.0** - November 25, 2025

### Added
* **Scan History**: The settings menu now displays cached statistics from the last file analysis, including the total number of files found, total size, and the time elapsed since the scan.

### Improved
* **CLI Info Section**: Cleaned up the CLI information area by consolidating installation instructions into a hover menu and refreshing the command block styling.
* **Security**: Hardened API authentication by implementing `hash_equals` for constant-time token comparison, protecting against timing attacks.
* **Concurrency**: Changed the naming convention for temporary synchronization zip files to use unique IDs (`uniqid`) instead of timestamps (`time()`). This prevents filename collisions when multiple file chunks are requested simultaneously.

## **v2.5.0** - November 21, 2025

**Added**
* **NCDU Command Support:** Added a new CLI command generator for `ncdu` (NCurses Disk Usage), allowing users to easily browse remote file system disk usage via the Disembark CLI.
* **Resumable File Streaming:** Updated the `stream_file` REST API endpoint to support `offset` and `length` parameters. This allows for chunked or resumable file downloads, improving reliability for large file transfers.
* **Updater Metadata:** The custom updater now passes `tested` (WordPress version) and `requires_php` fields to the plugin information screen.

**Changed**
* **Backup Workflow:** The "Start Backup" UI flow has been redesigned. Instead of immediately attempting a browser-based backup (which is prone to timeouts), the UI now generates a "Runner" command. This encourages users to run the migration via the terminal using a one-line `curl | bash` command for higher reliability.
* **CLI Command Generation:** The `migrateCommand` logic now dynamically builds a full runner command that includes all selected file and table exclusions directly in the generated string.
* **CLI Sync Command:** Updated the `sync` command format to include the domain as a second argument (`disembark sync <url> "<domain>"`).
* **Dashboard Redesign:** The main dashboard buttons ("Explore Files", "Start Backup") have been reorganized.
* **Tooltips:** Added tooltips to the CLI command block for better clarity on what `connect`, `backup`, `sync`, and `ncdu` commands do.

**Fixed**
* **Cleanup State:** Ensure UI state (`backup_ready`) is properly reset when running the cleanup routine.

## **v2.4.1** - November 11, 2025

### Changed

* **Analysis Performance:** The file analysis process ("Analyze Site") no longer generates MD5 checksums by default. This significantly improves scanning speed on large sites. Checksums are now only generated when explicitly requested by a client, such as for a `disembark sync` CLI command.

## **v2.4.0** - November 10, 2025

### Added
* **Backup Toggles:** Added "Backup Database" and "Backup Files" switches to the main interface, allowing you to easily skip an entire section of the backup.
* **CLI Command Update:** The generated CLI commands in the UI now dynamically add the `--skip-db` and `--skip-files` flags to match the new UI toggles.
* **UI Validation:** Added a check to prevent starting a backup if both the file and database sections are disabled.

### Changed
* **Smarter UI File Zipping:** The "Start Backup" process now filters the file list based on UI exclusions *in the browser* and sends batches of files to be zipped. This correctly respects all UI exclusions and is significantly more efficient than the previous method of re-zipping manifest chunks.
* **UI Polish:** The file and database exclusion lists are now hidden when their respective "Backup" toggles are switched off.

### Fixed
* **Filescan Performance:** Optimized the file scanning step by lowering the operation limit when checksums are enabled, preventing potential timeouts on slower hosts during the analysis phase.
* **UI Polish:** The database backup progress bar is now correctly hidden during a backup if the "Backup Database" option is disabled.

## **v2.3.0** - October 28, 2025

### Added
* **Database Batch Export:** Implemented a new batching system for database exports. The plugin now intelligently groups small tables (under 200MB and 1 million rows) into combined `.sql.txt` files. This dramatically reduces the number of API requests and zip operations, resulting in a much faster database backup.
* **Session ID & Manifest Regeneration:** The UI now displays a **Backup Session ID** after the initial analysis.
* A new "Regenerate Session" refresh icon allows you to update the file manifest with new exclusions *without* re-scanning the entire file system.
* This session ID can be used with the CLI (`--session-id=...`) to reuse the generated manifest.
* **New `sync` CLI Command:** Added the `disembark sync` command to the CLI instructions display, which works with the new session ID feature.
* **Database Row Count:** The database table list now fetches and displays the row count for each table, helping to identify large tables more easily.

### Changed
* **Smarter Backup Start:** The "Start Backup" button will now only regenerate the file manifest if you have changed your file/folder exclusions. If no exclusions have changed, it reuses the existing manifest, making the backup start almost instant.
* **UI Reset on Cleanup:** Clicking the "Cleanup Temporary Files" button now fully resets the plugin's UI to the initial "Analyze Site" screen. This prevents errors from trying to use a stale session after its files have been deleted.
* **Checksums Enabled by Default:** The file scanning process now generates MD5 checksums by default.
* **Improved CLI Copying:** The CLI commands in the UI are now on separate lines, making it easier to copy a single command at a time.

## **v2.2.1** - October 27, 2025
* **Fix:** Database listings for new `.sql.txt` extension

## **v2.2.0** - October 26, 2025

* **New Feature: Decoupled Filesystem Support (e.g., Flywheel)**
    * Reworked the file scanning, zipping, and streaming logic to fully support hosting environments where the WordPress core (`ABSPATH`) and the web root (`dirname(WP_CONTENT_DIR)`) are in separate locations.
    * The file scanner now identifies and scans both the web root and core root if they are different, using a `seen_files` log to prevent duplicates.
    * The zipping process now correctly locates files in either the web root or core root before adding them to the archive.
    * The File Explorer's streaming endpoint has been updated to find and stream files from a separate core directory, ensuring previews and downloads work correctly on decoupled sites.
* **Improvement: Database Export Compatibility**
    * Database export files are now saved with a `.sql.txt` extension instead of `.sql`.
    * This bypasses security rules on certain managed hosts that block the direct download of `.sql` files.
* **Improvement: Added Checksum Generation Support**
    * The `Backup` class can now optionally generate and include `md5_file` checksums in the file manifest during the scan step.
    * The `/regenerate-manifest` REST endpoint was updated to accept an `include_checksums` parameter to trigger this behavior, which is useful for external CLI validation.
* **Dev: New API Endpoints & UI Functionality**
    * Added a `/zip-sync-files` endpoint to create a zip archive from an arbitrary list of files sent from a client.
    * Added a `/regenerate-token` endpoint and a corresponding "Regenerate Token" button in the UI's Tools menu.
    * Added a "Regenerate Session" button in the UI to allow re-running the file manifest generation with the current exclusions without starting a new session.

## **v2.1.0** - October 23rd 2025

* **New Feature:** Added a "CLI Commands" panel to the main interface. The `disembark backup` command shown in this panel now dynamically updates to include all file (`-x "path"`) and database table (`--exclude-tables=...`) exclusions selected in the UI.
* **Security/Improvement:** Changed the `/stream-file` REST endpoint from `GET` to `POST`. The file path and token are now sent in the request body instead of query parameters, improving security.
* **Improvement:** Updated the File Explorer's "Preview" and "Download" features to work with the new `POST` streaming endpoint. File downloads are now handled via JavaScript to support the new method.
* **UI/UX:** Replaced the "Connection Info" menu with a new "Tools" menu. This new menu provides a helper command for installing the Disembark CLI and retains the "Cleanup Temporary Files" functionality.
* **Dev:** Added a new `delete_backup_file` method and a corresponding `/cleanup-file` REST endpoint to allow for the deletion of individual backup files (e.g., `files-1.zip`, `database.zip`) via the API.

## **v2.0.0** - October 16th 2025

* **Plugin Merger:** "Disembark Connector" and "Disembark Interface" have been combined into this single plugin.
* **New Integrated UI:** A full backup interface is now available directly in the WordPress admin under **Tools > Disembark**.
* **New File Explorer:** You can now browse your site's file structure, preview code and images, and download individual files from within the plugin.
* **New Granular Exclusions:** Added a visual interface to exclude specific files, folders, and database tables from your backup.
* **New Dark Mode:** Added a dark mode theme with a toggle that saves your preference.
* **Enhanced Large Site Support:** The file scanning process was rebuilt to use a multi-step, chunked approach to prevent timeouts on very large sites.
* **Improved Workflow:** The UI has been redesigned for a clearer state-driven process: Analyze, then Configure, then Backup.
* **Better Progress Feedback:** The interface now provides more detailed feedback during the site scan and backup.
* **Easy Access to Connection Info:** Your site's connection token and CLI commands are now easily accessible from a menu in the plugin's UI.
* **Upgrade Path:** Users of the "Disembark Connector" can upgrade directly to this plugin and should deactivate the old Connector plugin.
